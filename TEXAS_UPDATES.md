All original USCIS civics questions are still included, covering:
- American Government structure
- American History
- Rights and Responsibilities
- Geography
- American Symbols
- Civics

### 5 Additional Texas Questions
The app will randomly select questions from the complete set of 105, including the Texas-specific ones.

### Weighted Selection
The app uses weighted random selection to prioritize:
- Questions never asked (3× weight)
- Questions with <50% accuracy (2× weight)
- Questions with ≥50% accuracy (1× weight)

This applies to both federal and Texas questions, ensuring your wife practices Texas-specific content regularly.
